# GL02_Adomy [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/PunKeel/GL02_Adomy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PunKeel/GL02_Adomy)

We should maybe write some documentation here to present the project, explain why we've done that and how to use it.


# Contributing
`app.js` contains the publicly available library (the API), `lib/` contains everything we'll use (iCal parser, ...) that should be kept private.

`test/` contains the tests, and every file named `test/unit/*.js` will be automagically discovered and run.

To run the tests suite, just run `npm test`.
